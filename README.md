# Image_To_Dice_Art

This repository contains a Python script that processes an image to convert its grayscale values into a scale that represents dice faces (from 1 to 6). The example image used is "messi_image.jpeg", which is processed to simulate how the image would look when recreated using 900 black dices with white dots.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

- Pillow
- NumPy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy
